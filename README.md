# Running-Game-to-Json
This is a playnite Extension to expose GameStarted and GameStopped Events and save them as RunningGame.json

My Intention for this extension was to expand the functionality of my Category Switcher for Twitch/Kick with an integration of playnite

The json will be in this format

```
{
  "Event": "",
  "Name": "",
  "Source": "",
  "Type": "",
  "Path": ""
}
```

Event is GameStarted or GameStopped
